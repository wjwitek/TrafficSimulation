## Spawn points
Add to array "spawn_points", according to pattern:<br>
{<br>
    "coords": [x, y],<br>
    "spawn_probability": 20 (probability of point spawning 
new car [%/s])<br>
    "destination": [x1, y1, x2, y2, ..] (list of destination points)<br> 
    "destination_probability": [a1, a2, ..] (list of probability 
of destination points)<br> 
}
